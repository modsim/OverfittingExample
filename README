This code provides an example of how overfitting can occurr, even if a "correct" model is used, if insufficient data is at hand. 

The example is described in the publication "Ockhamâ€™s Razor in Biology: Keeping It Simple".

To run the code, execute the script "main.m" in matlab. Observe that the graphs produced take random data as input, and will differ slightly between consecurive runs.
